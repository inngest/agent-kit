### Architecture overview

- Ports (interfaces) in `core/ports/` define stable boundaries for transports and realtime connections.
- Adapters in `core/adapters/` implement those ports: HTTP requests and in-memory session behavior.
- Services in `core/services/` provide pure logic (reducer), state orchestration (engine), event mapping, and connection lifecycle.
- The React layer (`frameworks/react/`) composes these into hooks and a provider while staying thin and easily swappable.

Key flows:

- Realtime: `use-connection` uses `@inngest/realtime`’s hook with an explicit token refetcher. Messages are mapped with `event-mapper` and applied to the `streaming-reducer` via the `streaming-engine`.
- Threads: TanStack Query powers server pagination when a `QueryClientProvider` is present; otherwise a local fallback path is used. Thread flags (e.g., hasNewMessages) are overlaid from engine state.
- Cross-tab sync: `use-agent` broadcasts events and state snapshots via `BroadcastChannel` for multi-tab consistency and resumable streams (needs further testing and refinement).

### Notable design decisions

- Framework-agnostic core: reducer, engine, ports, and adapters have no React dependencies; React is an integration layer.
- Single source of truth for types in `src/types/index.ts` to avoid drift: message parts, event shapes, state, and errors.
- Token-required realtime: subscriptions are enabled only when a `refreshToken` is supplied; otherwise disabled by design.
- Defensive reducer: unknown actions are no-ops; ensures incremental evolution without regressions.
- Error model: HTTP errors are classified into recoverable/non-recoverable via `createAgentError` and surfaced consistently.

### Adapters and ports

HTTP transport (`DefaultHttpTransport`):

- Configurable endpoints; relative URLs are optionally prefixed by `baseURL`.
- Path param replacement + URI encoding for endpoints like `/api/threads/{threadId}`.
- Default headers/body functions can be async and are merged with per-request options.
- GET/DELETE never send a body; 204 responses resolve to `undefined`.
- Errors parse JSON `{error.message}` or `{message}` when available; otherwise fall back to HTTP status text. A rich `agentError` is attached.

Session transport (`InMemorySessionTransport`):

- Delegates runtime actions (send, token, approvals) to HTTP while keeping a per-tab in-memory thread list.
- Useful for demos or ephemeral experiences without persistence.

Realtime connection (`InngestConnection` + `ConnectionManager`):

- `InngestConnection` is a stub today (no real socket), establishing the seam for a non-React client in the future.
- `ConnectionManager` owns subscription lifecycle; `use-connection` currently uses the official React hook instead.

### Reducer, engine, and events

- `reduceStreamingState` handles:
  - Connection state → `isConnected`
  - Run lifecycle: `run.started` → thinking; `run.completed|stream.ended` → idle (+ finalize tools)
  - Message assembly: `part.created`, `text.delta`, `part.completed`
  - Tool calls: merges JSON argument deltas, accumulates tool output, finalizes on completion
  - Thread actions: set current thread, replace/clear messages, mark viewed, create/remove
- `StreamingEngine` holds state, notifies subscribers only on reference changes, and can wire a connection subscription.
- `event-mapper` converts raw chunks (with common envelopes) into typed `NetworkEvent` and supplies a simple thread/user filter.

### Threads and history

- `ThreadManager` merges server threads into local order, dedupes by `id`, revives dates, and parses cached entries defensively.
- History loading is domain-aware: if a thread claims messages but none are in state, a one-time revalidation fetch is triggered.
- `message-formatting` converts UI messages (including completed tool calls/results) into the AgentKit history format for the backend.

### React integration

- `AgentProvider` centralizes transport/connection and provides a `QueryClient` if not supplied. It also resolves a channel key in priority order: `channelKey` > `userId` > generated anonymous ID.
- `use-agent` is the unified hook exposing:
  - State: messages, status, connectivity, threads (+ flags), and errors
  - Actions: send/cancel, approve/deny tool calls, thread navigation, and history utilities
  - Works with or without a `QueryClientProvider`; falls back to local thread pagination if absent

### Roadmap notes

- Replace the React `use-connection` path with a framework-agnostic `InngestConnection` managed via `ConnectionManager` and bridge into React via `useSyncExternalStore`.
- Continue migrating logic into hexagonal core to keep React layer thin and easily swappable.
