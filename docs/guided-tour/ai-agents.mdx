## Overview

Our [Code Assistant v2](/ai-agents-in-practice/agentic-workflows) introduced some limited reasoning capabilities through Tools and a Network of Agents.
This third version will transform our Code Assistant into a semi-autonomous AI Agent that can solve bugs and improve code.

Our AI Agent will operate over an Express API project containing bugs:

```txt
/examples/code-assistant-agent/project
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── routes
│   │   ├── users.ts
│   │   └── posts.ts
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── user.ts
│   │   └── post.ts
│   └── db.ts
└── tests
    ├── users.test.ts
    └── posts.test.ts

```

Given a prompt such as:

```txt
Can you help me fix the following error?
1. TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'body')
   at app.post (/project/src/routes/users.ts:10:23)
```

Our Code Assistant v3 will autonomously navigate through the codebase and fix the bug by updating the impacted files.


This new version relies on previously covered concepts such as [Tools](/concepts/tools), [Agents](/concepts/agent), and [Networks](/concepts/network) but introduces
the creation of a custom [Router Agent](/concepts/routers#routing-agent-autonomous-routing) bringing routing autonomy to the AI Agent.


Let's learn these concepts in practice.

## Setup

Similarly to the [Code Assistant v2](/ai-agents-in-practice/agentic-workflows), perform the following steps to setup your project:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Initialize your project" defaultOpen="true">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm init
```

```bash yarn
yarn init
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Install the required dependencies">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @inngest/agent-kit zod
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit zod
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @inngest/agent-kit zod
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Add TypeScript support">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -D tsx @types/node
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install -D tsx @types/node
```

```bash yarn
yarn add -D tsx @types/node
```

</CodeGroup>

And add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "tsx ./index.ts"
}
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

You are now set up, let's implement our autonomous Code Assistant.

## Implementing our Code Assistant v3

### Overview of the autonomous workflow

Our Code Assistant v3 introduces autonomy through a specialized Router Agent that orchestrates two task-specific Agents:

- `plannerAgent`: Analyzes code and plans fixes using code search capabilities
- `editorAgent`: Implements the planned fixes using file system operations

The Router Agent acts as the "brain" of our Code Assistant, deciding which Agent to use based on the current context and user request.

Let's implement each component of our autonomous workflow.

### Implementing the Tools

Our Code Assistant v3 needs to interact with the file system and search through code. Let's implement these capabilities as Tools:

```typescript {10, 12, 28}
import { createTool } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const writeFile = createTool({
  name: "writeFile",
  description: "Write a file to the filesystem",
  parameters: z.object({
    path: z.string().describe("The path to the file to write"),
    content: z.string().describe("The content to write to the file"),
  }),
  handler: async ({ path, content }) => {
    try {
      let relativePath = path.startsWith("/") ? path.slice(1) : path;
      writeFileSync(relativePath, content);
      return "File written";
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`Error writing file ${path}:`, err);
      throw new Error(`Failed to write file ${path}`);
    }
  },
});

const readFile = createTool({
  name: "readFile",
  description: "Read a file from the filesystem",
  parameters: z.object({
    path: z.string().describe("The path to the file to read"),
  }),
  handler: async ({ path }) => {
    try {
      let relativePath = path.startsWith("/") ? path.slice(1) : path;
      const content = readFileSync(relativePath, "utf-8");
      return content;
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`Error reading file ${path}:`, err);
      throw new Error(`Failed to read file ${path}`);
    }
  },
});

const searchCode = createTool({
  name: "searchCode",
  description: "Search for a given pattern in a project files",
  parameters: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("The query to search for"),
  }),
  handler: async ({ query }) => {
    const searchFiles = (dir: string, searchQuery: string): string[] => {
      const results: string[] = [];
      const walk = (currentPath: string) => {
        const files = readdirSync(currentPath);
        for (const file of files) {
          const filePath = join(currentPath, file);
          const stat = statSync(filePath);
          if (stat.isDirectory()) {
            walk(filePath);
          } else {
            try {
              const content = readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");
              if (content.includes(searchQuery)) {
                results.push(filePath);
              }
            } catch (err) {
              console.error(`Error reading file ${filePath}:`, err);
            }
          }
        }
      };
      walk(dir);
      return results;
    };
    const matches = searchFiles(process.cwd(), query);
    return matches.length === 0
      ? "No matches found"
      : `Found matches in following files:\n${matches.join("\n")}`;
  },
});
```

<Note>

Some notes on the highlighted lines:

- As noted in the ["Building Effective Agents" article](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) from Anthropic, Tools based on file system operations are most effective when provided with absolute paths.
- Tools performing action such as `writeFile` should always return a value to inform the Agent that the action has been completed.

</Note>



These Tools provide our Agents with the following capabilities:
- `writeFile`: Write content to a file
- `readFile`: Read content from a file
- `searchCode`: Search for patterns in project files

Let's now create our task-specific Agents.

### Creating the Task-Specific Agents

Our Code Assistant v3 relies on two specialized Agents:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const plannerAgent = createAgent({
  name: "planner",
  system: "You are an expert in debugging TypeScript projects.",
  tools: [searchCode],
});

const editorAgent = createAgent({
  name: "editor",
  system: "You are an expert in fixing bugs in TypeScript projects.",
  tools: [writeFile, readFile],
});
```

Each Agent has a specific role:
- `plannerAgent` uses the `searchCode` Tool to analyze code and plan fixes
- `editorAgent` uses the `readFile` and `writeFile` Tools to implement fixes

Separating the Agents into two distinct roles will enable our AI Agent to better _"divide and conquer"_ the problem to solve.

Let's now implement the Router Agent that will bring the reasoning capabilities to autonomously orchestrate these Agents.

### Implementing the Router Agent

The [Router Agent](/concepts/routers#routing-agent-autonomous-routing) is the "brain" of our Code Assistant, deciding which Agent to use based on the context.

The router developed in the [Code Assistant v2](/ai-agents-in-practice/agentic-workflows) was a function that decided which Agent to call next
based on the progress of the workflow. Such router made a Agent deterministic, but lacked the reasoning capabilities to autonomously orchestrate the Agents.

In this version, we will provide an Agent as a router, called a Router Agent.
By doing so, we can leverage the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to autonomously orchestrate the Agents around a given goal (here, fixing the bug).

Creating a Router Agent is done by using the [`createRoutingAgent`](/reference/network-router#createroutingagent) helper function:

```typescript {5, 38, 70}
import { createRoutingAgent } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const router = createRoutingAgent({
    name: "Code Assistant routing agent",
    system: async ({ network }): Promise<string> => {
      if (!network) {
        throw new Error(
          "The routing agent can only be used within a network of agents"
        );
      }
      const agents = await network?.availableAgents();
      return `You are the orchestrator between a group of agents. Each agent is suited for a set of specific tasks, and has a name, instructions, and a set of tools.
      
      The following agents are available:
      <agents>
      ${agents
        .map((a) => {
          return `
        <agent>
          <name>${a.name}</name>
          <description>${a.description}</description>
          <tools>${JSON.stringify(Array.from(a.tools.values()))}</tools>
        </agent>`;
        })
        .join("\n")}
      </agents>
      
      Follow the set of instructions:
      
      <instructions>
      Think about the current history and status.
      If the user issue has been fixed, call select_agent with "finished"
      Otherwise, determine which agent to use to handle the user's request, based off of the current agents and their tools.
      
      Your aim is to thoroughly complete the request, thinking step by step, choosing the right agent based off of the context.
      </instructions>`;
    },
    tools: [
      createTool({
        name: "select_agent",
        description:
          "select an agent to handle the input, based off of the current conversation",
        parameters: z
          .object({
            name: z
              .string()
              .describe("The name of the agent that should handle the request"),
          })
          .strict(),
        handler: ({ name }, { network }) => {
          if (!network) {
            throw new Error(
              "The routing agent can only be used within a network of agents"
            );
          }
          if (name === "finished") {
            return undefined;
          }
          const agent = network.agents.get(name);
          if (agent === undefined) {
            throw new Error(
              `The routing agent requested an agent that doesn't exist: ${name}`
            );
          }
          return agent.name;
        },
      }),
    ],
    tool_choice: "select_agent",
    lifecycle: {
      onRoute: ({ result }) => {
        const tool = result.toolCalls[0];
        if (!tool) {
          return;
        }
        const agentName =
          (tool.content as any).data || (tool.content as string);
        if (agentName === "finished") {
          return;
        } else {
          return [agentName];
        }
      },
    },
});
```

Looking at the highlighted lines, we can see that a Router Agent mixes features from regular Agents and a function Router:
1. A Router Agent is a regular Agent with a `system` function that returns a prompt
2. A Router Agent can use [Tools](/concepts/tools) to interact with the environment
3. Finally, a Router Agent can also define lifecycle callbacks, [like Agents do](/concepts/agents#lifecycle-hooks)

Let's now dissect how this Router Agent works:
1. The `system` function is used to define the prompt dynamically based on the Agents available in the Network
    - You will notice that the prompt explicitly ask to call a "finished" tool when the user issue has been fixed
2. The `select_agent` Tool is used to validate that the Agent selected is available in the Network
    - The tool ensures that the "finished" edge case is handled
3. The `onRoute` lifecycle callback is used to determine which Agent to call next
    - This callback stops the conversation when the user issue has been fixed (when the "finished" Agent is called)

This is it! Using this prompt, our Router Agent will orchestrate the Agents until the given bug is fixed.

### Assembling the Network

Finally, assemble the Network of Agents and Router Agent:

```typescript
const network = createNetwork({
  name: "code-assistant-v3",
  agents: [plannerAgent, editorAgent],
  defaultModel: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    max_tokens: 4096,
  }),
  defaultRouter: router,
});
```

Our Code Assistant v3 is now complete and ready to be used!

## Running our Code Assistant v3

First, go to your Anthropic dashboard and create a new API key.

Then, run the following command to start the server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key> npm run start
```

```bash pnpm
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key> pnpm run start
```

```bash yarn
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key> yarn run start
```

</CodeGroup>

Your Code Assistant is now running at `http://localhost:3010` and ready to help fix bugs in your TypeScript projects!

## What we've learned so far

Let's recap what we've learned so far:

- **Autonomous AI Agents** can be built by using [**Router Agents**](/concepts/routers#routing-agent-autonomous-routing), which act as the "brain" of an autonomous system by orchestrating other Agents
- **Tools** provide Agents with capabilities to interact with their environment
