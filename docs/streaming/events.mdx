title: Events
---

The `use-agent` hook is built on an event-driven architecture. Real-time events are streamed from the server, processed by a state reducer, and used to build the conversation UI incrementally. This document details the events, their purpose, and how you can use them.

## Understanding the Event Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raw Event Streaming">
    A raw message is received from the Inngest realtime websocket connection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mapping">
    The raw message is passed to an internal `mapToNetworkEvent` function, which transforms it into a standardized, strongly-typed `AgentKitEvent`. Invalid or unrecognized messages are discarded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dispatch">
    The valid `AgentKitEvent` is dispatched to the internal `StreamingEngine`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reduction">
    The `streaming-reducer` processes the event. It uses a sequencing and buffering mechanism to ensure events are applied in the correct order, even if they arrive out of order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="State Update">
    The reducer applies the event to the state, creating or updating messages and their parts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="UI Render">
    Your React UI re-renders with the new state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Callbacks">
    If configured, `onEvent`, `onStreamEnded`, or `onToolResult` callbacks are fired, allowing you to react to specific events.
  </Step>

## Core Events Reference

### Run Lifecycle Events

These events manage the overall state of an agent or network execution for a given turn.

#### `run.started`

-   **Description**: Marks the beginning of an agent or network execution in response to a user message. This is often the first event in a sequence. It sets the agent's status to `submitted`.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `threadId`: The ID of the thread this run belongs to.
    -   `name`: The name of the agent or network that started.
    -   `scope`: `"network"` or `"agent"`.
    -   `runId`, `parentRunId`, `messageId`.
-   **State Impact**: Sets `runActive: true`, `agentStatus: 'submitted'`, and may reset the event processing sequence if it's the start of a new "epoch".

#### `run.completed`

-   **Description**: Indicates that an agent or network run has finished its logic. This does *not* mean all streaming is complete. It primarily finalizes any in-flight tool outputs.
-   **Payload (`data`)**: `threadId`, `scope`, `runId`, `messageId`, `name`.
-   **State Impact**: Finalizes the state of any tools that were in the `executing` state, moving them to `output-available`. The overall agent status is not yet changed to `ready`.

#### `stream.ended`

-   **Description**: The final event in a sequence. It indicates that all streaming for a turn is complete and the agent is now idle.
-   **Payload (`data`)**: `threadId`, `scope`, `runId`, `messageId`, `name`.
-   **State Impact**: Sets `runActive: false` and `agentStatus: 'ready'`. This signals that the system is ready for new user input.

### Content Streaming Events

These events are responsible for building the assistant's response message part by part.

#### `part.created`

-   **Description**: Signals the creation of a new part within an assistant message.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `messageId`: The ID of the message this part belongs to.
    -   `partId`: The unique ID for this new part.
    -   `type`: Either `"text"` or `"tool-call"`.
    -   `metadata`: Optional data, often includes `toolName` for tool calls.
-   **State Impact**: Adds a new, empty `TextUIPart` or `ToolCallUIPart` to the parts array of the corresponding message.

#### `text.delta`

-   **Description**: Streams a chunk of text for a `TextUIPart`.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `messageId`, `partId`.
    -   `delta`: The string of text to append.
-   **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` content to the specified `TextUIPart`.

#### `part.completed`

-   **Description**: Marks a specific message part as complete. The payload varies based on the part type.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `messageId`, `partId`.
    -   `type`: Can be `"text"`, `"tool-call"`, or `"tool-output"`.
    -   `finalContent`: The complete, final content for the part (e.g., the full text or final tool output).
-   **State Impact**:
    -   For `"text"`: Sets the part's `status` to `complete`.
    -   For `"tool-call"`: Sets the tool's `state` to `input-available` and populates the final `input`.
    -   For `"tool-output"`: Sets the tool's `state` to `output-available` and populates the final `output`.

### Tool Call Events

These events are specific to the lifecycle of tool calls made by an agent.

#### `tool_call.arguments.delta`

-   **Description**: Streams a chunk of the JSON arguments for a tool call.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `messageId`, `partId`.
    -   `delta`: A string chunk of the JSON arguments object.
-   **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` to the `input` field of the `ToolCallUIPart`. The reducer attempts to parse the accumulating string as JSON. Sets the tool's `state` to `input-streaming`.

#### `tool_call.output.delta`

-   **Description**: Streams a chunk of the output from a tool execution.
-   **Payload (`data`)**:
    -   `messageId`, `partId`.
    -   `delta`: A string chunk of the tool's output.
-   **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` to the `output` field of the `ToolCallUIPart`. Sets the tool's `state` to `executing`.

## Consuming Events in Your App

The `useAgents` hook provides callbacks to tap into this event stream.

### `onEvent`

This is the lowest-level callback. It fires for every single valid `AgentKitEvent` that the hook processes, giving you full visibility into the streaming process.

```jsx
useAgents({
  onEvent: (evt, meta) => {
    console.log('Event received:', evt.event, 'for thread:', meta.threadId);
    if (evt.event === 'run.started') {
      // Show a global "thinking" indicator
    }
  }
})
```

### `onToolResult`

A convenient, strongly-typed callback that fires only when a tool has finished executing and its final output is available (`part.completed` with `type: "tool-output"`).

```jsx
useAgents<MyAgentConfig>({
  onToolResult: (result) => {
    if (result.toolName === 'getWeather') {
      const weatherData = result.data; // strongly typed!
      // Display a custom weather component
    }
  }
})
```

### `onStreamEnded`

Fires when the entire sequence of events for a turn is complete (`stream.ended`). Useful for triggering actions after the assistant has fully responded.

```jsx
useAgents({
  onStreamEnded: ({ threadId }) => {
    console.log(`Agent has finished responding in thread ${threadId}.`);
    // Maybe run some analytics or enable the input field
  }
})
```
