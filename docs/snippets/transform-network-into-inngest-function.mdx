First, you'll need to create an Inngest Client:

```ts src/inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: 'my-agentkit-network',
});
```

Then, transform your AgentKit network into an Inngest function as follows:

```ts src/inngest/agent-network.ts {16-23, 26}
import { createAgent, createNetwork, createServer, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
import { inngest } from './inngest/client';


const deepResearchAgent = createAgent({ 
  name: 'Deep Research Agent',
  tools: [/* ... */],
});

const network = createNetwork({
  name: 'My Network',
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
  agents: [deepResearchAgent],
});

const deepResearchNetworkFunction = inngest.createFunction({ 
  id: 'deep-research-network',
}, {
  event: "deep-research-network/run"
}, async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { input } = event.data;
    return network.run(input);
})

const server = createServer({
  functions: [deepResearchNetworkFunction],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

The `network.run()` is now performed by the Inngest function.

Don't forget to register the function with `createServer`'s `functions` property.
