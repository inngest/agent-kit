Developing AgentKit applications locally is a breeze when combined with the [Inngest Dev Server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server).

The Inngest Dev Server is a local development tool that provides live traces and logs for your AgentKit applications, providing a
quicker feedback loop and full visibility into your AgentKit's state and Agent LLM calls:

## Using AgentKit with the Inngest Dev Server

### 1. Install the `inngest` package

To use AgentKit with the Inngest Dev Server, you need to install the `inngest` package.

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm install inngest
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm install inngest
```

```shell yarn
yarn add inngest
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Expose your AgentKit network over HTTP

The Inngest Dev Server needs to be able to trigger your AgentKit network over HTTP.
If your AgentKit network runs as a CLI, a few lines changes will make it available over HTTP:

```ts {1, 8-13}
import { createNetwork, createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const network = createNetwork({
  name: 'My Network',
  agents: [/* ... */],
});

const server = createServer({
  networks: [network],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

Now, starting your AgentKit script will make it available over HTTP.

Let's now trigger our AgentKit network from the Inngest Dev Server.



### 3. Trigger your AgentKit network from the Inngest Dev Server

You can start the Inngest Dev Server with the following command:

```shell
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

And navigate to the Inngest Dev Server by opening [http://127.0.0.1:8288](http://127.0.0.1:8288) in your browser.

You can now explore the Inngest Dev Server features:

### Inspect AgentKit Agents token usage, input and output

In the run view of your AgentKit network run, the Agents step will be highlighted with a âœ¨ green icon.
By expanding the step, you can inspect the Agents:
- The **model used**, ex: `gpt-4o`
- The **token usage** detailed as prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total tokens
- The **input** provided to the Agent
- The **output** provided by the Agent
