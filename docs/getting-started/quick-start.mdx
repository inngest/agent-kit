In this tutorial, you will create an [Agent](/concepts/agents) and run it within a [Network](/concepts/networks) using AgentKit.

<Info>
  Follow this guide by forking the [quick-start](https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/quick-start) example locally by running:

```shell
npx git-ripper https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/quick-start
```

## Creating a single agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install AgentKit">
    Within an existing project, install AgentKit from npm:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```shell npm
    npm install @inngest/agent-kit
    ```

    ```shell pnpm
    pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit
    ```

    ```shell yarn
    yarn add @inngest/agent-kit
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You can always find the latest release version on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/agent-kit).

    <Accordion title="Don't have an existing project?">
      To create a new project, create a new directory and initialize it using your package manager:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```shell npm
    mkdir my-agent-kit-project && npm init
    ```

    ```shell pnpm
    mkdir my-agent-kit-project && pnpm init
    ```

    ```shell yarn
    mkdir my-agent-kit-project && yarn init
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an agent">
    To start, we'll create our first "[Agent](/concepts/agents)." An Agent is an entity that has a specific role to answer questions or perform tasks (see "tools" below).

    Let's create a new file, `index.ts`. Using the `createAgent` constructor, give your agent a `name`, a `description`, and its initial `system` prompt. The `name` and `description` properties are used to help the LLM determine which Agent to call.

    You'll also specify which `model` you want the agent to use. Here we'll use Anthropic's [Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) model. ([Model reference](/concepts/models))

    Your agent can be whatever you want, but in this quick start, we'll create a PostgreSQL database administrator agent:

    ```ts index.ts
    import { createAgent, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

    const dbaAgent = createAgent({
      name: 'Database administrator',
      description: 'Provides expert support for managing PostgreSQL databases',
      system:
        'You are a PostgreSQL expert database administrator. ' +
        'You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL database schema, indexes, and extensions.',
      model: anthropic({
        model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-latest',
        defaultParameters: {
          max_tokens: 1000,
        },
      }),
    });
    ```

    You'll also need to set your provider API keys as environment variables:

    ```shell terminal
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-XXXXXX....
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the server">

    Next, we'll create an HTTP server to run our agent. In the same file as our Agent definition:

    ```ts index.ts
    import { createAgent, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
    import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server';
    // ...
    const server = createServer({
      agents: [dbaAgent],
    });
    server.listen(3000, () => console.log('AgentKit server running!'));
    ```

    Now we can run our AgentKit server using [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) and [`tsx`](https://tsx.is/) (for easy TypeScript execution):

    ```shell terminal
    npx tsx ./index.ts
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test our agent">
    To test our agent, we'll use the [Inngest dev server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/local-development) to visually debug our agents. Using `npx`, we'll start the server and point it to our AgentKit server:

    ```shell terminal
    npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://localhost:3000/api/inngest
    ```

    Now, open the dev server and select the functions tab (`http://localhost:8288/functions`) and click the "Invoke" button:

    ![Inngest Dev Server function list](/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-agent.png)

    In the Invoke function modal, specify the input prompt for your agent and click the "Invoke function" button:

    ![Inngest Dev Server invoke function modal](/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-invoke.png)

    ```json Invoke payload
    {
      "data": {
        "input": "How do I aggregate an integer column across a date column by week?"
      }
    }
    ```

    You'll be redirected to watch the agent run and view the output:

    ![Inngest Dev Server agent run](/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-agent-run.png)

  </Step>

  </Steps>

A key benefit of AgentKit is the ability to create a system of agents called a
"[Network](/concepts/networks)." Networks are used to create AI Agents by combining
multiple specialized [Agents](/concepts/agents) to answer more complex questions.
Let's transform our single agent into a network of two agents, capable of helping with
both database administration and security questions.

## Creating a multi-agent network

<Steps>
<Step title="Adding a second Agent">
Agents collaborate in a Network by sharing a common [State](/concepts/state).

Let's update our Database Administrator Agent to include a tool to save the answer to the question in the database:

```ts {13-24}
const dbaAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Database administrator",
  description: "Provides expert support for managing PostgreSQL databases",
  system:
    "You are a PostgreSQL expert database administrator. " +
    "You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL database schema, indexes, and extensions.",
  model: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    defaultParameters: {
      max_tokens: 4096,
    },
  }),
  tools: [
    createTool({
      name: "save_answer",
      description: "Save the answer to the questions",
      parameters: z.object({
        answer: z.string(),
      }),
      handler: async ({ answer }, { network }: Tool.Options<NetworkState>) => {
        network.state.data.dba_agent_answer = answer;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Info>
  [Tools](/concepts/tools) are based on [Tool
  Calling](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview),
  enabling your Agent to interact with the [State](/concepts/state) of the
  Network, store data in external databases, or dynamically fetch data from
  third-party APIs.
</Info>

Let's now create a second _Database Security_ Agent:

```ts {6-11, 26}
import { createAgent, anthropic } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

// ...

const securityAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Database Security Expert",
  description:
    "Provides expert guidance on PostgreSQL security, access control, audit logging, and compliance best practices",
  system:
    "You are a PostgreSQL security expert. " +
    "You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL security topics such as encryption, access control, audit logging, and compliance best practices.",
  model: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    defaultParameters: {
      max_tokens: 1000,
    },
  }),
  tools: [
    createTool({
      name: "save_answer",
      description: "Save the answer to the questions",
      parameters: z.object({
        answer: z.string(),
      }),
      handler: async ({ answer }, { network }: Tool.Options<NetworkState>) => {
        network.state.data.security_agent_answer = answer;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Our second Security Expert Agent is similar to the first, but with a different system prompt specifically for security questions.

We can now create a network combining our "Database Administrator" and "Database Security" Agents, which enables us to answer more complex questions.

</Step>

<Step title="Creating a Network">
Create a network using the `createNetwork` constructor. Define a `name` and include our agents from the previous step in the `agents` array.

You must also configure a `router` that the [_Router_](/concepts/routers) will use to determine which agent to call:

```ts {14, 15-25}
import { /*...*/ createNetwork } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

export interface NetworkState {
  // answer from the Database Administrator Agent
  dba_agent_answer?: string;

  // answer from the Security Expert Agent
  security_agent_answer?: string;
}

// ...
const devOpsNetwork = createNetwork<NetworkState>({
  name: "DevOps team",
  agents: [dbaAgent, securityAgent],
  router: async ({ network }) => {
    if (!network.state.data.security_agent_answer) {
      return securityAgent;
    } else if (
      network.state.data.security_agent_answer &&
      network.state.data.dba_agent_answer
    ) {
      return;
    }
    return dbaAgent;
  },
});

const server = createServer({
  agents: [dbaAgent, securityAgent],
  networks: [devOpsNetwork],
});
```

The highlighted lines are the key parts of our AI Agent behavior:

- The `agents` property defines the agents that are part of the network
- The `router` function defines the logic for which agent to call next. In this example, we call the Database Administrator Agent followed by the Security Expert Agent before ending the network (by returning `undefined`).

</Step>

  <Step title="Test our network">
We'll use the same approach to test our network as we did above.

With your Inngest dev server running, open the dev server and select the functions tab (`http://localhost:8288/functions`) and click the "Invoke" button of the _DevOps team_ function with the following payload:

```json Invoke payload
{
  "data": {
    "input": "I am building a Finance application. Help me answer the following 2 questions: \n - How can I scale my application to millions of requests per second? \n - How should I design my schema to ensure the safety of each organization's data?"
  }
}
```

The network will now run through the Agents to answer the questions:

![Inngest Dev Server agent run](/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-network-run.png)

You can inspect the answers of each Agent by selecting the _Finalization_ step and inspecting the JSON payload in the right panel:

![Inngest Dev Server agent run](/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-network-run-result.png)

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've now created your first AI Agent with AgentKit.

In this guide, you've learned that:

- [**Agents**](/concepts/agents) are the building blocks of AgentKit. They are used to call a single model to answer specific questions or perform tasks.
- [**Networks**](/concepts/networks) are groups of agents that can work together to achieve more complex goals.
- [**Routers**](/concepts/routers), combined with [**State**](/concepts/state), enable you to control the flow of your Agents.
