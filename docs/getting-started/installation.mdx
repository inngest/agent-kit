Install the AgentKit [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/agent-kit) and [Inngest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inngest) using your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
```

```shell yarn
yarn add @inngest/agent-kit inngest
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Important:** Starting with AgentKit v0.8.0, `inngest` is a required peer
  dependency. You must install both packages together to ensure proper runtime
  compatibility and prevent conflicts.
