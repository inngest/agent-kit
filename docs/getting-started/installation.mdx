Install the AgentKit [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/agent-kit) using your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm install @inngest/agent-kit
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit
```

```shell yarn
yarn add @inngest/agent-kit
```

</CodeGroup>

For a better local developement and production deployment experience, we recommend installing [Inngest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inngest) alongside AgentKit:

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm install inngest
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm install inngest
```

```shell yarn
yarn add inngest
```

</CodeGroup>
