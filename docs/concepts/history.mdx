## Overview

AgentKit enables persistent conversations that maintain context across multiple runs. By implementing a **History Adapter**, you can connect your agents and networks to any database or storage solution, allowing conversations to resume exactly where they left off.

A History Adapter is a configuration object that bridges AgentKit's execution lifecycle with your database. It tells AgentKit how to:

1. **Create** new conversation threads
2. **Load** existing conversation history
3. **Save** new messages and results

AgentKit is database-agnostic. You can use PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, or any
storage solution by implementing the `HistoryConfig` interface.

The adapter is passed to `createAgent()` or `createNetwork()` and AgentKit automatically calls your adapter's methods at the appropriate times during execution.

### HistoryConfig Interface

The `HistoryConfig` interface has three optional methods. Below is an expanded view of the interface showing the context and parameters passed to each method.

```typescript
import type {
  State,
  NetworkRun,
  AgentResult,
  GetStepTools,
  StateData,
} from "@inngest/agent-kit";

interface HistoryConfig<T extends StateData> {
  /**
   * Creates a new conversation thread.
   * Invoked at the start of a run if no `threadId` exists in the state.
   */
  createThread?: (ctx: {
    state: State<T>; // The current state, including your custom data
    input: string; // The user's input string
    network?: NetworkRun<T>; // The network instance (if applicable)
    step?: GetStepTools; // Inngest step tools for durable execution
  }) => Promise<{ threadId: string }>;

  /**
   * Retrieves conversation history from your database.
   * Invoked after thread initialization if no history is provided by the client.
   */
  get?: (ctx: {
    threadId: string; // The ID of the conversation thread
    state: State<T>;
    input: string;
    network: NetworkRun<T>;
    step?: GetStepTools;
  }) => Promise<AgentResult[]>;

  /**
   * Saves new messages to your database after a run.
   * Invoked at the end of a successful agent or network run.
   */
  appendResults?: (ctx: {
    threadId: string;
    newResults: AgentResult[]; // The new results generated during this run
    userMessage?: { content: string; role: "user"; timestamp: Date }; // The user's message
    state: State<T>;
    input: string;
    network: NetworkRun<T>;
    step?: GetStepTools;
  }) => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### `createThread`

- Creates a new conversation thread in your database
- Invoked at the start of a run if no `threadId` exists in the state
- Returns an object with the new `threadId`

#### `get`

- Retrieves conversation history from your database
- Invoked after thread initialization, but only if the client didn't provide `results` or `messages`
- Returns an array of `AgentResult[]` representing the conversation history

#### `appendResults`

- Saves new messages to your database after a network or agent run
- Invoked at the end of a successful agent or network run
- Receives only the _new_ results generated during this run (prevents duplicates)

## Usage

Here's a complete example of creating a network with history persistence:

```typescript
import {
  createNetwork,
  createAgent,
  createState,
  openai,
} from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { db } from "./db"; // Your database client

// Define your history adapter with all three methods
const conversationHistoryAdapter: HistoryConfig<any> = {
  // 1. Create new conversation threads
  createThread: async ({ state, input }) => {
    const thread = await db.thread.create({
      data: {
        userId: state.data.userId,
        title: input.slice(0, 50), // First 50 chars as title
        createdAt: new Date(),
      },
    });
    return { threadId: thread.id };
  },

  // 2. Load conversation history
  get: async ({ threadId }) => {
    if (!threadId) return [];

    const messages = await db.message.findMany({
      where: { threadId },
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
    });

    // Transform database records to AgentResult format
    return messages
      .filter((msg) => msg.role === "assistant")
      .map((msg) => ({
        agentName: msg.agentName,
        output: [
          {
            type: "text" as const,
            role: "assistant" as const,
            content: msg.content,
          },
        ],
        toolCalls: [],
        createdAt: new Date(msg.createdAt),
      }));
  },

  // 3. Save new messages
  appendResults: async ({ threadId, newResults, userMessage }) => {
    if (!threadId) return;

    // Save user message
    if (userMessage) {
      await db.message.create({
        data: {
          threadId,
          role: "user",
          content: userMessage.content,
          createdAt: userMessage.timestamp,
        },
      });
    }

    // Save agent responses
    for (const result of newResults) {
      const content = result.output
        .filter((msg) => msg.type === "text")
        .map((msg) => msg.content)
        .join("\n");

      await db.message.create({
        data: {
          threadId,
          role: "assistant",
          agentName: result.agentName,
          content,
          createdAt: result.createdAt,
        },
      });
    }
  },
};

// Create agents
const researcher = createAgent({
  name: "researcher",
  description: "Searches for information",
  model: openai({ model: "gpt-4" }),
});

const writer = createAgent({
  name: "writer",
  description: "Writes comprehensive responses",
  model: openai({ model: "gpt-4" }),
});

// Create network with history configuration
const assistantNetwork = createNetwork({
  name: "Research Assistant",
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4" }),
  history: conversationHistoryAdapter, // Add history adapter here
});

// Use the network - conversations will be automatically persisted
const state = createState(
  { userId: "user-123" },
  { threadId: "existing-thread-id" } // Optional: continue existing conversation
);

await assistantNetwork.run("Tell me about quantum computing", { state });
```

---

Once you've created your adapter, pass it to the `history` property when creating an agent or network:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Agent
import { createAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { postgresHistoryAdapter } from "./my-postgres-adapter";

const chatAgent = createAgent({
  name: "chat-agent",
  system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  history: postgresHistoryAdapter, // Add your adapter here
});

// Now the agent will automatically persist conversations
await chatAgent.run("Hello!", {
  state: createState({ userId: "user123" }, { threadId: "thread-456" }),
});
```

```typescript Network
import { createNetwork, createAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { postgresHistoryAdapter } from "./my-postgres-adapter";

const chatAgent = createAgent({
  name: "chat-agent",
  system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
});

const chatNetwork = createNetwork({
  name: "Chat Network",
  agents: [chatAgent],
  history: postgresHistoryAdapter, // Add your adapter here
});

// The entire network will use persistent conversations
await chatNetwork.run("Hello!");
```

</CodeGroup>

## Persistence Patterns

AgentKit supports two distint patterns for managing conversation history.

### Server-Authoritative

The client sends a message with a `threadId`. AgentKit automatically loads the full conversation context from your database before the network runs.

```typescript
// Client sends just the threadId
const state = createState(
  { userId: "user123" },
  { threadId: "existing-thread-id" }
);

await chatNetwork.run("Continue our conversation", { state });
// AgentKit calls history.get() to load full context for all agents
```

**Use case**: Perfect for restoring conversations after page refresh or when opening the app on a new device.

### Client-Authoritative (Performance Optimized)

The client maintains conversation state locally and sends the complete history with each request. AgentKit detects this and skips the database read for better performance.

```typescript
// Client sends the full conversation history
const state = createState(
  { userId: "user123" },
  {
    threadId: "thread-id",
    results: previousConversationResults, // Full history from client
  }
);

await chatNetwork.run("New message", { state });
// AgentKit skips history.get() call - faster performance!
// Still calls history.appendResults() to save new messages
```

**Use case**: Ideal for interactive chat applications where the frontend maintains conversation state and fetches messages from an existing/seperate API

### Server/Client Hybrid Pattern

You can combine the Server-Authoritative and Client-Authoritative patterns for an optimal user experience. This hybrid approach allows for fast initial conversation loading and high-performance interactive chat.

1.  **Initial Load (Server-Authoritative):** When a user opens a conversation thread, the client sends only the `threadId`. AgentKit fetches the history from your database using `history.get()`. The application then hydrates the client-side state with this history.
2.  **Interactive Session (Client-Authoritative):** For all subsequent requests within the session, the client sends the full, up-to-date history (`results` or `messages`) along with the `threadId`. AgentKit detects the client-provided history and skips the database read, resulting in a faster response.

**Use case**: Ideal for interactive chat applications where the frontend maintains conversation state but lets AgentKit fetch messages via their history adapter

## How Thread IDs Are Managed

AgentKit offers a flexible system for managing conversation thread IDs, ensuring that history is handled correctly whether you're starting a new conversation or continuing an existing one. Here's how AgentKit determines which `threadId` to use, in order of precedence:

1.  **Explicit `threadId` (Highest Priority):** The most direct method is to provide a `threadId` when you create your state. This is the standard way to resume a specific, existing conversation. AgentKit will use this ID to load the relevant history via the `history.get()` method.

    ```typescript
    // Continue a specific, existing conversation
    const state = createState(
      { userId: "user-123" },
      { threadId: "existing-thread-id-123" }
    );
    await network.run("Let's pick up where we left off.", { state });
    ```

2.  **Automatic Creation via `createThread`:** If you don't provide a `threadId`, AgentKit checks if your history adapter has a `createThread` method. If so, AgentKit calls it to create a new conversation thread in your database. Your `createThread` function is responsible for generating and returning the new unique `threadId`. This is the recommended approach for starting new conversations, as it ensures a record is created in your backend from the very beginning.

3.  **Automatic Generation (Fallback):** In cases where you don't provide a `threadId` and your history adapter does _not_ have a `createThread` method but _does_ have a `get` method, AgentKit provides a fallback. It will automatically generate a standard UUID and assign it as the `threadId` for the current run. This convenience ensures the conversation can proceed with a unique identifier for saving and loading history, even without an explicit creation step.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Inngest's Durable Steps">
    Wrap database operations in `step.run()` for automatic retries and durability.
    
    ```typescript
    await step.run("database-operation", async () => {
      return await db.someOperation();
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Missing Threads Gracefully">
    If a thread doesn't exist, return an empty array rather than throwing an error.
    
    ```typescript
    get: async ({ threadId }) => {
      if (!threadId) return [];
      
      const messages = await db.getMessages(threadId);
      return messages || []; // Handle null/undefined gracefully
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Index Your Database Properly">
    Ensure you have indexes on `thread_id` and `created_at` columns for fast queries.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_messages_thread_id ON messages(thread_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_messages_created_at ON messages(created_at);
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
