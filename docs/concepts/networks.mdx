Networks are **Systems of [Agents](/concepts/agents)**. Use Networks to create complex, stateful workflows with one or more Agents.

A network contains three components:

- The Agents that the network can access
- [State](/concepts/), including past messages and a key value store
- A [Router](/concepts/routers), which chooses whether to quit or the next agent to run in the loop

It also has an optional default model, which will be used when your Agents have no model provided, and a setting to cap the number of model calls via `maxIter`.

Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// Create a network with two agents.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  // Optional: used for routing and agents if they have no model
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o', step }),
  maxIter: 10, // Optional: max number of agent calls
});

// Run the network with a user prompt
await network.run('What happened in the 2024 Super Bowl?');
```

Similar to agents, you call `run()` on a network with some user input. The network then runs a core loop to call one or more agents to find a suitable answer.

## How Networks work

Networks can be thought of as while loops with memory that call Agents and Tools until the Router determines that there is no more work to be done.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Network of Agents">
    You create a network with a list of available [Agents](/concepts/agents).
    Each Agent can use a different [model and inference
    provider](/concepts/models).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the staring prompt">
    You give the network a user prompt by calling `run()`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Core execution loop">
    The network runs its core loop:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Call the Network router">
        The [Router](/concepts/routers) decides the first Agent to run with your
        input.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Run the Agent">
        Call the Agent with your input. This also runs the agent's
        [lifecycles](/concepts/agents#lifecycle-hooks), and any
        [Tools](/concepts/tools) that the model decides to call.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Store the result">
        Stores the result in the network's [State](/concepts/state). State can
        be accessed by the Router or other Agent's Tools in future loops.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the the Router again ↩️">
        Return to the top of the loop and calls the Router with the new State.
        The Router can decide to quit or run another Agent.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>
