Networks are **Systems of [Agents](/concepts/agents)**. Use Networks to create powerful AI workflows by combining multiple Agents.

A network contains three components:

- The [Agents](/concepts/agents) that the network can use to achieve a goal
- A [State](/concepts/state) including past messages and a key value store, shared between Agents and the Router
- A [Router](/concepts/routers), which chooses whether to stop or select the next agent to run in the loop

Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

// Create a network with two agents.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
});

// Run the network with a user prompt
await network.run('What happened in the 2024 Super Bowl?');
```

By calling `run()`, the network runs a core loop to call one or more agents to find a suitable answer.

## How Networks work

Networks can be thought of as while loops with memory ([State](/concepts/state)) that call Agents and Tools until the Router determines that there is no more work to be done.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Network of Agents">
    You create a network with a list of available [Agents](/concepts/agents).
    Each Agent can use a different [model and inference
    provider](/concepts/models).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the staring prompt">
    You give the network a user prompt by calling `run()`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Core execution loop">
    The network runs its core loop:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Call the Network router">
        The [Router](/concepts/routers) decides the first Agent to run with your
        input.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Run the Agent">
        Call the Agent with your input. This also runs the agent's
        [lifecycles](/concepts/agents#lifecycle-hooks), and any
        [Tools](/concepts/tools) that the model decides to call.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Store the result">
        Stores the result in the network's [State](/concepts/state). State can
        be accessed by the Router or other Agent's Tools in future loops.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the the Router again ↩️">
        Return to the top of the loop and calls the Router with the new State.
        The Router can decide to quit or run another Agent.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Model configuration

A Network must provide a default model which is used for routing between Agents and for Agents that don't have one:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
});
```

<Info>
A Network not defining a `defaultModel` and composed of Agents without model will throw an error.
</Info>

### Combination of multiple models

Each Agent can specify it's own model to use so a Network may end up using multiple models. Here is an example of a Network that defaults to use an OpenAI model, but the `summaryAgent` is configured to use an Anthropic model:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const searchAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Search',
  description: 'Search the web for information',
});

const summaryAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Summary',
  description: 'Summarize the information',
  model: anthropic({ model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet' }),
});

// The searchAgent will use gpt-4o, while the summaryAgent will use claude-3-5-sonnet.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
});
```

## Routing & maximum iterations


### Routing

A Network can specify an optional `defaultRouter` function that will be used to determine the next Agent to run.

```ts
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  defaultRouter: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // retrieve the last message from the output
    const lastMessage = lastResult?.output[lastResult?.output.length - 1];
    const content = lastMessage?.type === 'text' ? lastMessage?.content as string : '';
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && content.includes('question')) {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```


Refer to the [Router](/concepts/routers) documentation for more information about how to create a custom Router.

### Maximum iterations

A Network can specify an optional `maxIter` setting to limit the number of iterations.

```tsx
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
  maxIter: 10,
});
```

<Info>
Specifying a `maxIter` option is useful when using a [Default Routing Agent](/concepts/routers#default-routing-agent-autonomous-routing) or a [Hybrid Router](/concepts/routers#hybrid-code-and-agent-routers-semi-supervised-routing) to avoid infinite loops.

A Routing Agent or Hybrid Router rely on LLM calls to make decisions, which means that they can sometimes fail to identify a final condition.
</Info>

### Combining `maxIter` and `defaultRouter`

You can combine `maxIter` and `defaultRouter` to create a Network that will stop after a certain number of iterations or when a condition is met.

However, please note that the `maxIter` option can prevent the `defaultRouter` from being called (For example, if `maxIter` is set to 1, the `defaultRouter` will only be called once).


## Providing a default State

A Network can specify an optional `defaultState` setting to provide a default [State](/concepts/state).

```tsx
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultState: new State({
    foo: 'bar',
  }),
});
```

Providing a `defaultState` can be useful to persist the state in database between runs or initialize your network with external data.
