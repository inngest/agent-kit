Networks are Systems of [Agents](/concepts/agents). Networks turn Agents into powerful stateful workflows.

A network contains three components:

- The agents that the network can access
- The network's state, including past messages and a key value store (read more below)
- The network's router, which chooses whether to quit or the next agent to run in the loop (read more below)

It also has an optional default model, which will be used when your Agents have no model provided, and a setting to cap the number of model calls via `maxIter`.

Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, agenticOpenai as openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// Create a network with two agents.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o', step }), // Optional: used for routing and agents if they have no model
  maxIter: 10, // Optional: max number of agent calls
});

// Run the network with a user prompt
await network.run('What happened in the 2024 Super Bowl?');
```

Similar to agents, you call `.run` on a network with some user input. The network then runs a core loop to call one or more agents to find a suitable answer.

## How networks work

Networks are designed to be powerful while being easy to understand:

1. You create a network with a list of available agents. Each agent can use a different model and inference provider.
2. You give the network a user prompt by calling `.run`
3. The network runs its core loop, and:
   - Calls the router, which picks the first agent to run
   - Runs the agent with your input. This also runs the agent’s lifecycles, and any tools selected.
   - Stores the result in the network's state
   - Re-calls the router with the new state, which either quits or runs another agent
