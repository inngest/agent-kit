The purpose of a Network's **Router** is to decide what [Agent](/concepts/agents) to call based off the current Network [State](/concepts/state).

## What is a Router?

A router is a function that gets called after each agent runs, which decides whether to:

1. Call another agent (by returning an `Agent`)
2. Stop the network's execution loop (by returning `undefined`)

The routing function gets access to everything it needs to make this decision:

- The [Network](/concepts/networks) object itself, including it's [State](/concepts/state).
  {/* TODO - The "stack" of agents isn't clear how this stack is created and when they are executed in relation to the router */}
- The stack of [Agents](/concepts/agents) to be called.
- The number of times the Network has called Agents (_the number of iterations_).
- The result from the previously called Agent in the Network's execution loop.

For more information about the role of a Router in a Network, read about [how Networks work](/concepts/networks#how-networks-work).

## Using a Router

<Tip>
  Providing a custom Router to your Network is optional. If you don't provide
  one, the Network will use the "Default Router" Routing Agent.
</Tip>

Providing a custom Router to your Network can be achieved using 3 different patterns:

- **Writing a custom [Code-based Router](/concepts/routers#code-based-routers-supervised-routing)**: Define a function that makes decisions based on the current [State](/concepts/state).
- **Creating a [Routing Agent](/concepts/routers#routing-agent-autonomous-routing)**: Leverages LLM calls to decide which Agents should be called next based on the current [State](/concepts/state).
- **Writing a custom [Hybrid Router](/concepts/routers#hybrid-code-and-agent-routers-semi-supervised-routing)**: Mix code and agent-based routing to get the best of both worlds.

## Creating a custom Router

Custom Routers can be provided by defining a `defaultRouter` function returning either an instance of an `Agent` object or `undefined`.

```ts
import { createNetwork } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // retrieve the last message from the output
    const lastMessage = lastResult?.output[lastResult?.output.length - 1];
    const content =
      lastMessage?.type === "text" ? (lastMessage?.content as string) : "";
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && content.includes("question")) {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```

The `defaultRouter` function receives a number of arguments:

```ts @inngest/agent-kit
interface RouterArgs {
  network: Network; // The entire network, including the state and history
  stack: Agent[]; // Future agents to be called
  callCount: number; // Number of times the Network has called agents
  lastResult?: InferenceResult; // The the previously called Agent's result
}
```

The available arguments can be used to build the routing patterns described below.

## Routing Patterns

### Tips

- Start simple with code-based routing for predictable behavior, then add agent-based routing for flexibility.
- Remember that routers can access the network's [state](/concepts/state)
- You can return agents that weren't in the original network
- The router runs after each agent call
- Returning `undefined` stops the network's execution loop

That's it! Routing is what makes networks powerful - it lets you build workflows that can be as simple or complex as you need.

### Code-based Routers (supervised routing)

The simplest way to route is to write code that makes decisions. Here's an example that routes between a classifier and a writer:

```ts
import { createNetwork } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // retrieve the last message from the output
    const lastMessage = lastResult?.output[lastResult?.output.length - 1];
    const content =
      lastMessage?.type === "text" ? (lastMessage?.content as string) : "";
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && content.includes("question")) {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```

Code-based routing is great when you want deterministic, predictable behavior. It's also the fastest option since there's no LLM calls involved.

### Routing Agent (autonomous routing)

Without a `defaultRouter` defined, the network will use the "Default Routing Agent" to decide which agent to call next.
The "Default Routing Agent" is a Routing Agent provided by Agent Kit to handle the default routing logic.

You can create your own Routing Agent by using the [`createRoutingAgent`](/reference/network-router#createroutingagent) helper function:

```ts
import { createRoutingAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

const routingAgent = createRoutingAgent({
  name: "Custom routing agent",
  description: "Selects agents based on the current state and request",
  lifecycle: {
    onRoute: ({ result, network }) => {
      // custom logic...
    },
  },
});

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: routingAgent,
});
```

<Warning>
  Routing Agents look similar to Agents but are designed to make routing
  decisions: - Routing Agents cannot have Tools. - Routing Agents provides a
  single `onRoute` lifecycle method.
</Warning>

### Hybrid code and agent Routers (semi-supervised routing)

And, of course, you can mix code and agent-based routing. Here's an example that uses code for the first step, then lets an agent take over:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, getDefaultRoutingAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ callCount }) => {
    // Always start with the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Then let the routing agent take over
    return getDefaultRoutingAgent();
  },
});
```

This gives you the best of both worlds:

- Predictable first steps when you know what needs to happen
- Flexibility when the path forward isn't clear

### Using state in Routing

The router is the brain of your network - it decides which agent to call next. You can use state to make smart routing decisions:

```tsx
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// mathAgent and contextAgent Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [mathAgent, contextAgent],
  router: ({ network, lastResult }): Agent | undefined => {
    // Check if we've solved the problem
    const solution = network.state.kv.get('solution');
    if (solution) {
      // We're done - return undefined to stop the network
      return undefined;
    }

    // retrieve the last message from the output
    const lastMessage = lastResult?.output[lastResult?.output.length - 1];
    const content = lastMessage?.type === 'text' ? lastMessage?.content as string : '';

    // Check the last result to decide what to do next
    if (content.includes('need more context')) {
      return contextAgent;
    }

    return mathAgent;
  };
});
```
