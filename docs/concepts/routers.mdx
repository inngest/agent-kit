The purpose of a Network's **Router** is to decide what [Agent](/concepts/agents) to call based off the current Network [State](/concepts/state).

## What is a Router?

A router is a function that gets called after each agent runs, which decides whether to:

1. Call another agent (by returning an `Agent`)
2. Stop the network's execution loop (by returning `undefined`)

The routing function gets access to everything it needs to make this decision:

- The Network object itself, including it's State.
  {/* TODO - The "stack" of agents isn't clear how this stack is created and when they are executed in relation to the router */}
- The stack of Agents to be called.
- The number of times the Network has called Agents.
- The result from the previously called Agent in the Network's execution loop.

For more information about the role of a Router in a Network, read about [how Networks work](/concepts/networks#how-networks-work).

{/* ## Default Router */}
{/* TODO - Must explain how the default router works with the model as it's pretty opaque how things are run now. */}

## Creating a custom Router

Custom Routers can be defined using two approaches:

1. A `router` function.
2. A routing Agent.

Router functions can be created by defining a single function passed to the `createNetwork`'s `router` option. The function receives a number of arguments:

```ts
interface RouterArgs {
  network: Network; // The entire network, including the state and history
  stack: Agent[]; // Future agents to be called
  callCount: number; // Number of times the Network has called agents
  lastResult?: InferenceResult; // The the previously called Agent's result
}
```

The `router` function then either returns an instance of an `Agent` object or `undefined`.

```ts
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    if (lastResult?.output.match(/xyz/)) {
      return writer;
    }
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && lastResult?.output === 'question') {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```

## Types of Routers

### Code-based Routers (supervised routing)

The simplest way to route is to write code that makes decisions. Here's an example that routes between a classifier and a writer:

```ts
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && lastResult?.output === 'question') {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```

Code-based routing is great when you want deterministic, predictable behavior. It's also the fastest option since there's no LLM calls involved.

### Agent Routers (autonomous routing)

Sometimes you want your network to be more dynamic. Agent-based routing uses an LLM to decide what to do next. The network comes with a built-in routing agent that you can use:

```tsx
import { Network, agenticOpenai as openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  defaultModel: model,
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    return defaultAgenticRouter;
  },
});
```

The routing agent looks at:

- The original input
- What agents are available
- The conversation history
- Each agent's description

It then decides whether to call another agent or stop. This is great for building autonomous workflows where you're not sure what steps are needed up front. Note that the default agentic router is a starting point. In production apps it’s likely that you define your own agentic router props specifically for the network’s use case.

### Hybrid code and agent Routers (semi-supervised routing)

And, of course, you can mix code and agent-based routing. Here's an example that uses code for the first step, then lets an agent take over:

```tsx
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // Always start with the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Then let the routing agent take over
    return defaultAgenticRouter;
  },
});
```

This gives you the best of both worlds:

- Predictable first steps when you know what needs to happen
- Flexibility when the path forward isn't clear

### Using state in Routing

The router is the brain of your network - it decides which agent to call next. You can use state to make smart routing decisions:

```tsx
const router = ({ network, lastResult }): Agent | undefined => {
  // Check if we've solved the problem
  const solution = network.state.kv.get('solution');
  if (solution) {
    // We're done - return undefined to stop the network
    return undefined;
  }

  // Check the last result to decide what to do next
  if (lastResult?.output[0].content.includes('need more context')) {
    return contextAgent;
  }

  return mathAgent;
};
```

### Tips for routing

- Start simple with code-based routing
- Use agent-based routing when you need flexibility
- Remember that routers can access the network's state
- You can return agents that weren't in the original network
- The router runs after each agent call

That's it! Routing is what makes networks powerful - it lets you build workflows that can be as simple or complex as you need.
