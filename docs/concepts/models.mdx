Within AgentKit, models are adapters that wrap a given provider (ex. OpenAI, Anthropic)'s specific model version (ex. `gpt-3.5`).

Each [Agent](/concepts/agents) can each select their own model to use and a [Network](/concepts/networks) can select a default model.

```ts
import { openai, anthropic, gemini } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
```

## How to use a model

<CodeGroup>

```ts OpenAI
import { openai, createAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

const supportAgent = createAgent({
  model: openai("gpt-3.5-turbo"),
  name: "Customer support specialist",
  system: "You are an customer support specialist...",
  tools: [listChargesTool],
});
```

```ts Anthropic
import { anthropic, createAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

const supportAgent = createAgent({
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-haiku-latest"),
  name: "Customer support specialist",
  system: "You are an customer support specialist...",
  tools: [listChargesTool],
});
```

```ts Gemini
import { gemini, createAgent } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

const supportAgent = createAgent({
  model: gemini("claude-3-5-haiku-latest"),
  name: "Customer support specialist",
  system: "You are an customer support specialist...",
  tools: [listChargesTool],
});
```
