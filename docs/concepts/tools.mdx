Tools are functions that extend the capabilities of an [Agent](/concepts/agents). Tools have two core uses:

- Calling code, enabling models to interact with systems like your own database or external APIs.
- Turning unstructured inputs into structured responses.

A list of all available Tools and their configuration is sent in [an Agent's inference calls](/concepts/agents#how-agents-work) and a model may decide that a certain tool or tools should be called to complete the task. Tools are included in an Agent's calls to language models through features like OpenAI's "[function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)" or Claude's "[tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use)."

## Creating a Tool

Each Tool's `name`, `description`, and `parameters` are part of the function definition that is used by model to learn about the tool's capabilities and decide when it should be called. The `handler` is the function that is executed by the Agent if the model decides that a particular Tool should be called.

Here is a simple tool that lists charges for a given user's account between a date range:

```ts
import { createTool } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const listChargesTool = createTool({
  name: 'list_charges',
  description:
    "Returns all of a user's charges. Call this whenever you need to find one or more charges between a date range.",
  parameters: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    created: z.object({
      gte: z.string().date(),
      lte: z.string().date(),
    }),
  }),
  handler: async ({ userId, created }, { network, agent, step }) => {
    // input is strongly typed to match the parameter type.
    return [{...}]
  },
});
```

Writing quality `name` and `description` parameters help the model determine when the particular Tool should be called.

### Optional parameters

Optional parameters should be defined using `.nullable()` (not `.optional()`):

```ts {7-10}
const listChargesTool = createTool({
  name: 'list_charges',
  description:
    "Returns all of a user's charges. Call this whenever you need to find one or more charges between a date range.",
  parameters: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    created: z.object({
      gte: z.string().date(),
      lte: z.string().date(),
    }).nullable(),
  }),
  handler: async ({ userId, created }, { network, agent, step }) => {
    // input is strongly typed to match the parameter type.
    return [{...}]
  },
});
```
