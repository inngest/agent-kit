Agents are the core of AgentKit. Agents are _stateless_ entities with a defined goal and an optional set of [Tools](/concepts/tools) that can be used to accomplish a goal.

Agents can be called individually or, more powerfully, composed into a [Network](/concepts/networks) with multiple agents that can work together with persisted [State](/concepts/state).

At the most basic level, an Agent is a wrapper around a specific provider's [model](/concepts/models), OpenAI gpt-4 for example, and a set of of [tools](/concepts/tools).

## Creating an Agent

To create a simple Agent, all that you need is a `name`, `system` prompt and a `model`. All configuration options are detailed in the `createAgent` [reference](/reference/agent). Here is a simple agent created using the `createAgent` function:

```ts
import { createAgent, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const codeWriterAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Code writer',
  system:
    'You are an expert TypeScript programmer.  Given a set of asks, you think step-by-step to plan clean, ' +
    'idiomatic TypeScript code, with comments and tests as necessary.' +
    'Do not respond with anything else other than the following XML tags:' +
    '- If you would like to write code, add all code within the following tags (replace $filename and $contents appropriately):' +
    "  <file name='$filename.ts'>$contents</file>",
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
});
```

<Tip>
  While `system` prompts can be static strings, they are more powerful when they
  are [dynamic system prompts](#dynamic-system-prompts) defined as callbacks
  that can add additional context at runtime.
</Tip>

Any Agent can be called using `run()` with a user prompt. This performs an inference call to the model with the system prompt as the first message and the input as the user message.

```ts
const { output } = codeWriterAgent.run(
  'Write a typescript function that removes unnecessary whitespace',
);
console.log(output);
// [{ role: 'assistant', content: 'function removeUnecessaryWhitespace(...' }]
```

<Tip>
  When including your Agent in a Network, a `description` is required. Learn
  more about [using Agents in Networks here](#using-agents-in-networks).

## Adding tools

[Tools](/concepts/tools) are functions that extend the capabilities of an Agent. Along with the prompt (see `run()`), Tools are included in calls to the language model through features like OpenAI's "[function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)" or Claude's "[tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use)."

Tools are defined using the `createTypedTool` function and are passed to agents via the `tools` parameter:

```ts
import { createAgent, createTypedTool, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const listChargesTool = createTypedTool({
  name: 'list_charges',
  description:
    "Returns all of a user's charges. Call this whenever you need to find one or more charges between a date range.",
  parameters: z.array(
    z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
    }),
  ),
  handler: async (output, { network, agent, step }) => {
    // output is strongly typed to match the parameter type.
  },
});

const supportAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Customer support specialist',
  system: 'You are an customer support specialist...',
  model: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
  tools: [listChargesTool],
});
```

When `run()` is called, any step that the model decides to call is immediately executed before returning the output. Read the "[How agents work](#how-agents-work)" section for additional information.

Learn more about Tools in [this guide](/concepts/tools).

## How Agents work

Agents themselves are relatively simple. When you call `run()`, there are several steps that happen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparing the prompts">
    The initial messages are created using the `system` prompt, the `run()` user
    prompt, and [Network State](/concepts/network-state), if the agent is part
    of a [Network](/concepts/networks).

    <Info>
      For added control, you can dynamically modify the Agent's prompts before the next step using the `onStart` [lifecycle hook](#lifecycle-hooks).
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Inference call">
    {/* TODO - Update this when Inngest isn't a requirement */}
    An inference call is made to the provided [`model`](/concepts/models) using Inngest's `step.ai`. `step.ai` automatically retries on failure and caches the result for durability.

    The result is parsed into an `InferenceResult` object that contains all messages, tool calls and the raw API response from the model.

    <Info>
      To modify the result prior to calling tools, use the optional `onResponse` [lifecycle hook](#lifecycle-hooks).
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool calling">
    If the model decides to call one of the available `tools`, the Tool is automatically called.

    <Info>
      After tool calling is complete, the `onFinish` [lifecycle hook](#lifecycle-hooks) is called with the updated `InferenceResult`. This enables you to modify or inspect the output of the called tools.
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    The result is returned to the caller.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Lifecycle hooks

Agent lifecycle hooks can be used to intercept and modify how an Agent works enabling dynamic control over the system. As mentioned in the "[How Agents work](#how-agents-work)" section, there are a few lifecycle hooks that can be defined on the Agent's `lifecycle` options object.

- Dynamically alter prompts using Network [State](/concepts/state) or the Network's history.
- Parse output of model after an inference call.

Learn more about lifecycle hooks and how to define them in [this reference](/reference/create-agent#lifecycle).

## System prompts

An Agent's system prompt can be defined as a string or an async callback. When Agents are part of a [Network](/concepts/networks), the Network [State](/concepts/state) is passed as an argument to create dynamic prompts, or instructions, based on history or the outputs of other Agents.

### Dynamic system prompts

Dynamic system prompts are very useful in agentic workflows, when multiple models are called in a loop, prompts can be adjusted based on network state from other call outputs.

```ts Dynamic system prompt
const agent = createAgent({
  name: 'Code writer',
  description:
    'An expert TypeScript programmer which can write and debug code.',

  // The system prompt can be dynamically created at runtime using Network state:
  system: async ({ network }) => {
    // A default base prompt to build from:
    const basePrompt =
      'You are an expert TypeScript programmer. ' +
      'Given a set of asks, think step-by-step to plan clean, ' +
      'idiomatic TypeScript code, with comments and tests as necessary.';

    // Inspect the Network state, checking for existing code saved as files:
    const files: Record<string, string> | undefined =
      network?.state.kv.get('files');
    if (!files) {
      return basePrompt;
    }

    // Add the files from Network state as additional context automatically
    let additionalContext = 'The following code already exists:';
    for (const [name, content] of Object.entries(files)) {
      additionalContext += `<file name='${name}'>${content}</file>`;
    }
    return `${basePrompt} ${additionalContext}`;
  },
});
```

### Static system prompts

Agents may also just have static system prompts which are more useful for simpler use cases.

```ts
const codeWriterAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Copy editor',
  system:
    `You are an expert copy editor. Given a draft article, you provide ` +
    `actionable improvements for spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting.`,
  model: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
});
```

## Using Agents in Networks

Agents are the most powerful when combined into [Networks](/concepts/networks). Networks include [state](/concepts/state) and [routers](/concepts/routers) to create stateful workflows that can enable Agents to work together to accomplish larger goals.

### Agent descriptions

Similar to how [Tools](/concepts/tools) have a `description` that enables an LLM to decide when to call it, Agents also have an `description` parameter. This is _required_ when using Agents within Networks. Here is an example of an Agent with a description:

```ts
const codeWriterAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Code writer',
  description:
    'An expert TypeScript programmer which can write and debug code. Call this when custom code is required to complete a task.',
  system: `...`,
  model: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
});
```
