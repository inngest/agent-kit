AgentKit is a framework to build AI Agents, from single model inference calls to multi-agent systems that use tools. Designed with orchestration at it's core, AgentKit enables developers to build, test, and deploy reliable AI applications at scale.

With AgentKit, you get:

‚ú® **Simple and composable primitives** to build from simple Support Agents to semi-autonomous Coding Agents.

üß† **Support for [OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini](/concepts/models)** and all OpenAI API compatible models.

üõ†Ô∏è **Powerful tools building API** with support for [Claude's Model Context Protocol as tools](/advanced-patterns/mcp).

üîå **Integrates** with your favorite AI libraries and products (ex: [E2B](/integrations/e2b), [Browserbase](/integrations/browserbase), [Smithery](/integrations/smithery)).

üìä **[Local Live traces](/getting-started/local-development) and input/output logs** when combined with the Inngest Dev Server.

## How AgentKit works

<div className="flex gap-4">

<div className="flex-1 py-8 mr-5">
  AgentKit enables developers to compose simple single-agent systems or entire
  _systems of agents_ in which multiple agents can work together.
  **[Agents](/concepts/agents)** are combined into
  **[Networks](concepts/networks)** which include a
  **[Router](concepts/routers)** to determine which Agent should be called.
  Their system's memory is recorded as Network **[State](concepts/state)** which
  can be used by the Router, Agents or **[Tools](concepts/tools)** to
  collaborate on tasks.

</div>

The entire system is orchestration-aware and allows for customization at runtime for dynamic, powerful AI workflows and agentic systems. Here is what a simple Network looks like in code:

```ts
import {
  createNetwork,
  createAgent,
  openai,
  anthropic,
} from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { searchWebTool } from "./tools";

const navigator = createAgent({
  name: "Navigator",
  system: "You are a navigator...",
  tools: [searchWebTool],
});

const classifier = createAgent({
  name: "Classifier",
  system: "You are a classifier...",
  model: openai("gpt-3.5-turbo"),
});

const summarizer = createAgent({
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-haiku-latest"),
  name: "Summarizer",
  system: "You are a summarizer...",
});

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [navigator, classifier, summarizer],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
});

const input = `Classify then summarize the latest 10 blog posts
  on https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/`;

const result = await network.run(input, ({ network }) => {
  // Use an agent which figures out the specific agent to call
  // based off of the network's history.
  return defaultRoutingAgent;
});
```
