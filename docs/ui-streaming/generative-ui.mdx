description: Rendering text and tool-call parts with statuses.

Common parts to render:

- `text` (status: streaming → complete)
- `tool-call` (states: input-streaming → input-available → executing → output-available)

Tips:

- Show typing indicators during `run.started`/`responding`
- Surface errors from thread state when present
