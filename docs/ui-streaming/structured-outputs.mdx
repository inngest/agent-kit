title: Structured Outputs
description: Model structured results via tools; stream args/output.
---

- Tool input is streamed via `tool_call.arguments.delta` (JSON string chunks)
- Tool output is streamed via `tool_call.output.delta`
- Finalization via `part.completed` with structured `finalContent`

Render guidance:

- Accumulate JSON safely; show partial state; finalize on completion
