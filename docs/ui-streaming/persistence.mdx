description: Server history hooks and client transports.

Server-side (AgentKit History):

- `createThread` (upsert)
- `appendUserMessage` (persist at run start)
- `get` (hydrate history if client didnâ€™t provide messages)
- `appendResults` (save only new results)

Client-side:

- Default HTTP transport expects routes for chat, token, threads

Architecture Options: (TBA)
