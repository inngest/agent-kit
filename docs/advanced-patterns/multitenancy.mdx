As discussed in the [deployment guide](/concepts/deployment), moving an AgentKit network into users' hands requires configuring usage limits.

To avoid having one user's usage affect another, you can configure multi-tenancy.

Multi-tenancy consists of configuring limits based on users or organizations (_called "tenants"_).
It can be easily configured on your AgentKit network using Inngest.


<Info>
**Prerequisites**

Your AgentKit network [must be configured with Inngest](/getting-started/local-development#1-install-the-inngest-package).

</Info>

## Configuring Multi-tenancy

Adding multi-tenancy to your AgentKit network is done by transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function.

### Transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function

<TransformNetworkIntoInngestFunction />

### Configuring a concurrency per user

We can now configure the capacity by user by adding concurrency and throttling configuration to our Inngest function:

```ts src/inngest/agent-network.ts {8-13}
import { createAgent, createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server';

import { inngest } from './inngest/client';

// network and agent definitions..

const deepResearchNetworkFunction = inngest.createFunction({ 
  id: 'deep-research-network',
  concurrency: [
      {
        key: "event.data.user_id",
        limit: 10,
      },
    ],
}, {
  event: "deep-research-network/run"
}, async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { input } = event.data;

    return network.run(input);
})

const server = createServer({
  functions: [deepResearchNetworkFunction],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

Your AgentKit network will now be limited to 10 concurrent requests per user.

The same can be done to add [throttling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/throttling?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy), [rate limiting](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/rate-limiting?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy) or [priority](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/priority?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy).
