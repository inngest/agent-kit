Using AgentKit alongside Inngest enables automatic retries for your AgentKit network Agents and Tools calls.

The default retry policy is to retry 4 times with exponential backoff and can be configured by following the steps below.



<Info>
**Prerequisites**

Your AgentKit network [must be configured with Inngest](/getting-started/local-development#1-install-the-inngest-package).

## Configuring Retries

Configuring a custom retry policy is done by transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function.

### Transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function

<TransformNetworkIntoInngestFunction />

### Configuring a custom retry policy

We can now configure the capacity by user by adding concurrency and throttling configuration to our Inngest function:

```ts src/inngest/agent-network.ts {8}
import { createAgent, createNetwork, createServer, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
import { inngest } from './inngest/client';

// network and agent definitions..

const deepResearchNetworkFunction = inngest.createFunction({ 
  id: 'deep-research-network',
  retries: 1
}, {
  event: "deep-research-network/run"
}, async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { input } = event.data;

    return network.run(input);
})

const server = createServer({
  functions: [deepResearchNetworkFunction],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

Your AgentKit network will now retry once on any failure happening during a single execution cycle of your network.
