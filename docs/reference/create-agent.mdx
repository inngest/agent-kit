description: 'Define an agent'
---

Agents are defined using the `createAgent` function.

```ts
import { createAgent, agenticOpenai as openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const agent = createAgent({
  name: 'Code writer',
  system:
    'You are an expert TypeScript programmer.  Given a set of asks, you think step-by-step to plan clean, ' +
    'idiomatic TypeScript code, with comments and tests as necessary.' +
    'Do not respond with anything else other than the following XML tags:' +
    '- If you would like to write code, add all code within the following tags (replace $filename and $contents appropriately):' +
    "  <file name='$filename.ts'>$contents</file>",
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
});
```

## Options

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the agent. Displayed in tracing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  Optional description for the agent, used for LLM-based routing to help the
  network pick which agent to run next.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="model" type="string" required>
  The provider model to use for inference calls.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="system" type="string | function" required>
  The system prompt, as a string or function. Functions let you change prompts
  based off of state and memory.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tools" type="array<TypedTool>">
  Defined tools that an agent can call.

Tools are created via [`createTool`](/reference/createTool).

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lifecycle" type="Lifecycle">
  Lifecycle hooks that can intercept and modify inputs and outputs throughout the stages of execution of `run()`.

Learn about each [lifecycle](#lifecycle) hook that can be defined below.

</ParamField>

### `lifecycle`

<ParamField path="onStart" type="function">
  Called after the initial prompt messages are created and before the inference call request. The `onStart` hook can be used to:

- Modify input prompt for the Agent.
- Prevent the agent from being called by throwing an error.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onResponse" type="function">
Called after the inference call request is completed and before tool calling. The `onResponse` hook can be used to:

- Inspect the tools that the model decided to call.
- Modify the response prior to tool calling.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onFinish" type="function">
Called after tool calling has completed. The `onFinish` hook can be used to:

- Modify the `InferenceResult` including the outputs prior to the result being added to [Network state](/concepts/network-state).

</ParamField>
