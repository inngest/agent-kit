# Agent kit

`@inngest/agent-kit` lets developers build, test, and deploy reliable AI applications
at scale — from single model calls to multi-agent workflows that use tools.
Using the SDK lets you focus on AI code instead of technical details like
orchestration, state, or infrastructure.

A networked agent:
```ts
// Create a network of agents with separate tasks and instructions
// to solve // a specific task.
const network = new Network({
  agents: [navigator, classifier, summarizer],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4o", step }),
})

const input = `Classify then summarize the latest 10 blog posts
  on https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/`

const result = await network.run(input, ({ network }) => {
  // Use an agent which figures out the specific agent to call
  // based off of the network's history.
  return defaultRoutingAgent;
});
```

A simple agent:
```ts
const writer = new Agent({
  name: "writer",
  system: "You are an expert writer.  You write readable, concise, simple content.",
  model: openai({ model: "gpt-4o", step }),
});

const { output } = await writer.run(
  "Describe the ideas behind the given input into clear topics, and explain any insight: " +
  `<content>${content}</content>`
);
```

## Installation

Agent kit requires the [Inngest TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) as a dependency. You can install both via `npm` or similar:

```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
```

## Documentation
