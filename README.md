# Agent kit

`@inngest/agent-kit` lets developers build, test, and deploy reliable AI applications
at scale — from single model calls to multi-agent workflows that use tools.
Using the SDK lets you focus on AI code instead of technical details like
orchestration, state, or infrastructure.

## Installation

Agent kit requires the [Inngest TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) as a dependency. You can install both via `npm` or similar:

```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
```

## Documentation

The full Agent kit documentation is available
